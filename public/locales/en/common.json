In the event of no home consumption or excess power consumption, all unused solar electricity can be returned to the grid at the same tariff cost at which you buy solar energy from a utility company. If this volume exceeds this volume, the sale of electricity will be carried out at wholesale rates.",

Often, the load schedule for energy carriers at enterprises is uneven, the load peak is during the day, which allows solar power plants to be the most effective solution for most commercial activities. In addition, the use of solar power plants allows you to quickly and easily increase the input power of the facility or create a reliable reservation of the most important nodes that are unacceptable in operation. If the object is largely dependent on the central network, you can use an autonomous solar power plant on its own, as well as in combination with an alternative energy source."
